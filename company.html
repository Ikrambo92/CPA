                                    Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties in the United Kingdom. They are
                                    calculated based on the rateable
                                    value of the property, which is a measure of its annual rental value. The rateable
                                    value is multiplied by a multiplier
                                    to determine the amount of business rates payable.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The 2023 revaluation of business rates has resulted in an increase in the rateable
                                    value of many properties. This means
                                    that businesses will be paying more in business rates in 2023. The impact of this
                                    increase will vary depending on the
                                    size and location of the business.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Small businesses are likely to be most affected by the increase in business rates.
                                    This is because they are more likely
                                    to be located in high-value areas, where the rateable value has increased
                                    significantly. The increase in business rates
                                    could put a strain on small businesses' finances and make it difficult for them to
                                    compete with larger businesses.

                                    The government has introduced a number of reliefs to help businesses with the
                                    increase in business rates. These reliefs
                                    include a 75% discount for retail, hospitality, and leisure businesses, and a 100%
                                    discount for businesses with a
                                    rateable value of less than Â£12,000. However, these reliefs will not be enough to
                                    offset the increase in business rates
                                    for all businesses.
